🃏 3. Card Draw Probability Explorer
- Objective: Simulate drawing cards from a deck and calculate compound and conditional probabilities.

🔧 Tasks:
- Create a virtual 52-card deck
- Simulate:
    - Drawing 2 cards without replacement
    - P(both cards are hearts), P(1st is red | 2nd is red)
- Run 10,000 simulations
- Compare empirical vs theoretical probabilities
- Export results (CSV + bar chart)

📦 Skills Used:
- Card modeling with itertools
- Compound & conditional probabilities
- Simulation analysis
