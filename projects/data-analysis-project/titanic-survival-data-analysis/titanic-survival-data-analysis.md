ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Data Analysis
- Objective: Analyze Titanic passenger data to understand the impact of factors like age, gender, class, and fare on survival rate.

ðŸ”§ Tasks:
- Load the Titanic dataset (train.csv from Kaggle or Seaborn).
- Clean data:
    - Handle missing values in age, cabin, and embarked columns.
    - Convert categorical features like sex and embarked using astype('category').
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):
    - Analyze survival rate by gender, class, and age group.
    - Visualize distributions using histograms and box plots.
- Use groupby() and aggregation to calculate survival statistics.
- Create pivot tables and crosstabs for survival by multiple factors.
- Export cleaned data and analysis results to CSV.

ðŸ“¦ Skills Used:
- Missing value handling
- Categorical encoding
- Grouping and aggregation
- Pivot tables and crosstabs
- Basic data visualization
