ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Project

ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Analysis
- Objective: Analyze the classic Iris dataset to identify patterns in petal and sepal measurements across species.

ðŸ”§ Tasks:
- Load the Iris dataset using seaborn.load_dataset('iris') or from UCI repository.
- Explore the dataset:
    - Check distribution of species and feature correlations.
    - Visualize relationships using scatter plots and pair plots.
- Clean data:
    - Check for duplicates and null values.
    - Convert species to categorical type.
- Perform analysis:
    - Group by species and calculate mean petal/sepal dimensions.
    - Identify which features best separate the species.
- Export summary statistics and charts to CSV/PNG.

ðŸ“¦ Skills Used:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data grouping and summarization
- Feature correlation and visualization
- Category-based statistical insights
