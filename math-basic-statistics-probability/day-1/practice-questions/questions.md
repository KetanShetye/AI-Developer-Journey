6. What is the standard deviation of [10, 12, 14, 16]?
7. Find mean and median of [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
8. What is the range of [100, 102, 98, 97, 103]?

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level Questions

1. Compute mean, median, mode for [12, 15, 12, 14, 15, 15, 14]
2. Write a function to calculate variance manually.
3. Find population vs sample variance for [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
4. A dataset [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] has one outlier: 100. How does it affect the mean?
5. Compare standard deviation of [1, 1, 1, 1] vs [1, 5, 10, 15]
6. How many modes does [3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9] have?
7. Write code to calculate range, variance, and std dev of a list
8. Create a random dataset of 10 values and find all descriptive stats
9. Use NumPy to compute mean, std, var, range of random data
10. What is the effect of adding a constant to every value on mean and std dev?

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level Questions

1. A student scores [70, 72, 73, 80, 120] â€” Is the 120 an outlier? Use std dev to explain.
2. Write a Python function to return all modes in a multimodal dataset.
3. Compare variance and std dev between two same-mean datasets with different spreads.
4. What happens to variance if you multiply each value by 10?
5. Given data is normally distributed, how much of it lies within 1 std dev from mean?
6. Simulate 1000 random numbers and plot histogram + std dev lines.
7. How would you impute missing values using mean/median in a dataset?
8. Implement trimmed mean (removing top & bottom 10%) in Python.
9. Design a real-world scenario where mean is misleading but median is not.
10. Analyze skewness using mean vs median vs mode difference.
