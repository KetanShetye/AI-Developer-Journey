# 📊 Week 4 Plan: Basic Statistics & Probability (1 Hour/Day)

Learn the foundation of statistics and probability to prepare for ML model evaluation, feature understanding, and data exploration.

---

## 🔢 Day 1: Descriptive Statistics Basics
- Concepts:
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Range, Variance, Standard Deviation

---

## 🧮 Day 2: Variability & Spread
- Concepts:
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)

---

## 🧠 Day 3: Introduction to Probability
- Concepts:
  - Basic probability rules
  - Events, outcomes, sample space
  
---

## 🧮 Day 4: Conditional Probability & Independence
- Concepts:
  - Conditional probability: P(A|B)
  - Independent events vs dependent events

---

## 📉 Day 5: Probability Distributions
- Concepts:
  - Compound Events
  - Bayes' Theorem
  - Uniform, Binomial, Normal Distributions (basic shapes and uses)
  - Probability Density Functions (PDF)
- Practice:
  - Plot Normal distribution using `matplotlib`, calculate probability areas
- Resource:
  - Khan Academy: [Distributions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data)

---

## 🔁 Day 6: Review + Practice Problems
- Activities:
  - Solve 10+ MCQs or problems on stats/probability
  - Revisit areas of confusion
- Resources:
  - Khan Academy practice sets + Python coding from previous days

---

## ✅ Day 7: Mini Project or Quiz
- Choose one:
  - Analyze a dataset using descriptive statistics (e.g., student scores)
  - Build a simple probability simulation (e.g., dice, card draw)
- Document in Jupyter Notebook or GitHub

---

**Tip**: Always apply concepts practically using Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib).
