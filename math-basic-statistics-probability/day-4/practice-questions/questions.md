# ðŸ”¢ Math Basic Statistics Probability Day 3 â€“ Practice Questions

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level Questions

1. If P(A âˆ© B) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.5, find P(A|B).
2. In a class, 40% students play football, and 30% play both football and cricket. Find P(Football | Cricket).
3. A coin is tossed and a die is rolled. Are the two events independent? Why?
4. In a weather forecast, if P(Rain) = 0.4 and P(Umbrella | Rain) = 0.9, what does this mean?
5. Explain the difference between dependent and independent events using coin toss and card draw.
6. Two coins are tossed. What is the probability that the second toss is heads given the first is tails?
7. Are drawing cards with replacement and without replacement independent or dependent? Why?
8. If P(B) = 0.3 and P(A âˆ© B) = 0.15, calculate P(A|B).
9. Give an example of two events that are definitely dependent.
10. Use Python to simulate: If you draw a red ball from a bag of 5 red and 5 blue balls (no replacement), whatâ€™s the chance the next is red?

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level Questions

1. A test detects a disease with 95% accuracy. If 2% of population has the disease, use Bayes' idea to find P(disease | positive test).
2. Are two rolls of a fair die independent? Justify mathematically.
3. In a bag: 5 red, 3 green balls. If 2 balls are drawn without replacement, find P(both green).
4. Python: Simulate 10,000 runs of a dice roll. Estimate P(even | >2).
5. P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.5, P(A âˆ© B) = 0.1 â†’ Are A and B independent?
6. If P(A|B) = P(A), what does that say about the relationship between A and B?
7. In a deck of cards, calculate P(King | face card).
8. From a dataset of 100 users, 30 bought a product and 15 also clicked the ad. Find P(Buy | Click).
9. A company records that 60% of its users log in daily. 90% of daily users also use mobile. Find P(Mobile | Daily).
10. Use Python to simulate conditional probability of "person above 60" being sick, from a random sample.

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level Questions

1. A survey shows 80% of people with umbrellas experienced rain. If only 40% of days had rain, estimate P(Rain | Umbrella).
2. Derive general formula for P(A âˆª B) using conditional probability and apply it.
3. Given P(A) = 0.5, P(B) = 0.4, and P(A|B) = 0.75, find P(A âˆ© B).
4. Prove that if A and B are independent, then A and B' are also independent.
5. Python: Simulate conditional probability using pandas DataFrame of customers and purchases.
6. If a security camera has 90% accuracy and false alarm rate is 5%, simulate Bayesâ€™ rule with Python.
7. A fair die is rolled twice. What is P(2nd roll is >3 | 1st roll was even)?
8. Use Python: Create a function that accepts two events and returns whether they are independent (using proportions from data).
9. A dataset has 3% fraud rate. Fraud detection system triggers 20% of the time and catches 95% of frauds. Estimate P(Fraud | Alert).
10. In a game: P(Win) = 0.3, P(Bonus | Win) = 0.8. Simulate 10,000 games to estimate how often both occur.
