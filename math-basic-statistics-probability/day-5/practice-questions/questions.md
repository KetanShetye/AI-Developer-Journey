## üü° Intermediate Level Questions

1. A machine detects defects correctly 90% of the time. Only 1% of products are actually defective.
   Use Bayes‚Äô Theorem to estimate the chance a detected defect is real.
2. A bag has 3 red, 5 blue balls. Draw 2 balls without replacement. Find P(both red).
3. Calculate P(A ‚à™ B) if P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.5, and P(A ‚à© B) = 0.2.
4. Use Python to simulate a binomial distribution: Toss a fair coin 10 times, 1000 trials.
5. Use `scipy.stats.norm` to find probability of getting a value between -1 and 1 in a standard normal distribution.
6. Explain how PDF is different from PMF (probability mass function).
7. If a value lies 2 standard deviations from the mean in normal distribution, is it likely or rare?
8. Plot a binomial distribution in Python for n=20, p=0.3.
9. Use Python to generate 10,000 samples from a normal distribution and plot a histogram.
10. A class has 80% students who did homework. 90% of those passed. What‚Äôs the chance a student passed given they did homework?

## üî¥ Advanced Level Questions

1. Prove that the total probability under a PDF curve must equal 1 using integration.
2. Given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.1, and P(B) = 0.5, use Bayes‚Äô Theorem to find P(A|B).
3. A card is drawn from a deck. Then another is drawn without replacement. What is the probability both are face cards?
4. Python: Write a function that returns P(A|B) from any data table using proportions.
5. Simulate 100,000 coin flips using binomial distribution and plot the histogram.
6. Plot two normal curves: one with std = 1 and one with std = 3. Explain the difference visually.
7. Use the Central Limit Theorem to simulate how means of samples form a normal distribution.
8. Given a real-world dataset (e.g., heights), plot histogram and overlay normal PDF.
9. A test for spam detection flags 10% of all emails, but only 1% are actually spam. What is the chance that a flagged email is spam?
10. Write a Python script that calculates area under a normal curve between any two z-values using integration or `scipy.stats.norm.cdf`.
