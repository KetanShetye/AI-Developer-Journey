## üü¢ Beginner Level Questions



1. Write a lambda function to square a number and use it on a list of integers.
2. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
3. Explain and demonstrate local vs global variables with a simple function.
4. Write a closure that returns a function adding a fixed number to its argument.
5. Write a simple decorator that prints "Function started" before calling any function.
6. Create a higher-order function that takes a function and applies it twice on a value.
7. Use function annotations to annotate a function that concatenates two strings.
8. Write a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
9. Write a lambda function to filter even numbers from a list.
10. Write a decorator that counts how many times a function has been called.

## üü° Intermediate Level Questions

1. Implement a recursive function to reverse a string.
2. Write a closure that generates unique IDs starting from a given number.
3. Create a decorator that logs function name and arguments every time it is called.
4. Use a higher-order function to apply multiple functions sequentially to an input value.
5. Demonstrate the difference between local, nonlocal, and global variables in nested functions.
6. Write a function with annotations that takes a list of integers and returns their average as float.
7. Implement a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
8. Write a lambda function inside a map to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
9. Create a decorator that caches results of a function (simple memoization).
10. Implement a higher-order function that returns a function to multiply by a given factor.

## üî¥ Advanced Level Questions

1. Write a recursive function that generates all permutations of a string.
2. Implement a closure-based decorator that accepts arguments to control how many times a function can be called.
3. Write a decorator that measures and prints the execution time of a function.
4. Implement a function using annotations and type hints to parse and validate JSON input (simulate type checking).
5. Write a higher-order function that composes multiple functions into a single callable.
6. Use recursion with memoization (decorator) to efficiently compute the nth Fibonacci number.
7. Demonstrate how to modify a global variable inside a nested function using the `global` keyword.
8. Write a closure that implements a simple event handler storing event listeners internally.
9. Create a decorator that retries a function execution n times if it raises an exception.
10. Implement a function with complex annotations using the `typing` module (e.g., `Callable`, `List`, `Union`) and explain their meaning.
