## üü¢ Beginner Level Questions

1. What is Python and where is it used?
2. List three popular Python IDEs.
3. How do you run a `.py` file in VS Code?
4. Write a Python program that prints your name.
5. Create variables of type `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool` and print them.
6. Use `type()` to print the data type of the following:
   - `"Hello"`  
   - `123`  
   - `12.34`  
   - `True`
7. Convert the number `10` to string and print both the value and type.
8. Ask the user for their name and age, and print a welcome message.
9. Create a variable `price = "100"` (string) and convert it into an integer.
10. What‚Äôs the output and type of: `type(str(123))`, `type(int("123"))`, `type(float("123.45"))`

## üü° Intermediate Level Questions

1. What is the difference between dynamically and statically typed languages? Which one is Python?
2. Create a variable of type `float` and convert it into `int`, `str`, and `bool`.
3. Swap the values of two variables using Python.
4. Ask the user to enter a number. Print whether the input is `int`, `float`, or `str` using `type()` and `try-except`.
5. Why is Python called a high-level language? Give 2 examples of its readability benefits.
6. Create a program that asks the user for three inputs (age, name, salary) and prints their types.
7. What will happen if you try to convert `"abc"` into an integer using `int()`?
8. Take a float input from the user and convert it to:
   - Integer  
   - String  
   - Boolean  
   Then print all converted values and their types.
9. Write a program that creates one variable for each Python built-in data type and prints the type of each.
10. Difference between `=` (assignment) and `==` (comparison) with examples.

## üî¥ Advanced Level Questions

1. Create a **type inference program**: Ask the user to input a value and try to intelligently guess whether it's an `int`, `float`, `bool`, or `str` (handle errors gracefully).
2. Create a **universal type converter** tool: Ask the user to input a value and a target type (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`) and convert accordingly using conditionals and `try-except`.
3. Accept input as a string like `"100.5"` and print converted values in all possible types that make sense (int, float, bool).
4. Build a mini **type conversion quiz**: Give a value, ask what type conversion will succeed or fail.
5. Write a program that checks if the data type of the input changes after conversion and logs all the transitions.
6. Create a Python script that mimics part of the `type()` function, printing:
   - Original input  
   - Detected type  
   - Possible valid conversions
7. Build a **variable info tool** that takes a variable and prints:
   - Type  
   - Memory location  
   - Value  
   - Whether it is mutable or immutable
