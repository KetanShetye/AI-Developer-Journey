# 🐍 Python Day 13 – Practice Questions

## 🟢 Beginner Level Questions



1. Create a class `Person` with attributes name and age. Initialize it and print the details.
2. Define a class `Circle` with a method to calculate area using the radius.
3. Create a class `Car` with attributes and a method to display them.
4. Define a class `Student` that stores name and marks. Add a method to check if the student passed (marks > 40).
5. Create a `Book` class with `__str__` method overridden.
6. Write a program to demonstrate the use of a class variable (like a counter to count objects).
7. Implement a simple `Calculator` class with `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` methods.
8. Create a class `Animal` and a method `speak`. Inherit a class `Dog` that overrides `speak`.
9. Demonstrate class method using `@classmethod` to modify a class variable.
10. Write a program to use `@staticmethod` inside a class.

7. Create a class `Employee` with a method to compare salaries of two employees using `__gt__()`.
8. Implement a simple mixin pattern to add logging functionality to multiple classes.
9. Create a class with `__len__()` overridden and use `len()` function on it.
