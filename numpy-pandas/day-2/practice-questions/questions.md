# 🐍 NumPy and Pandas in Python Day 2 – Practice Questions

## 🟢 Beginner Level Questions

1. Create a 1D NumPy array of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Create a 3x3 matrix filled with zeros.
3. Create a 2D array with ones and set the center element to 9.
4. Find the shape and data type of a given NumPy array.
5. Convert a Python list to a NumPy array and print its type.
6. Create a NumPy array of 5 float numbers and convert them to integers.
7. Reshape a 1D array of 9 elements into a 3x3 matrix.
8. Flatten a 2D array into 1D using `flatten()`.
9. Access the element at 2nd row, 3rd column of a 3x3 array.
10. Slice the first two rows and first two columns of a 3x3 matrix.

## 🟡 Intermediate Level Questions

1. Create a 4x4 matrix and extract the diagonal elements.
2. Create an array of 20 random integers and find all elements > 10.
3. Add a 1D array `[1, 2, 3]` to each row of a 3x3 matrix using broadcasting.
4. Given a 2D array, subtract the row mean from each row (normalize rows).
5. Transpose a 3x2 matrix and verify the shape.
6. Create a matrix with values ranging from 10 to 90 and reshape it to 4x5.
7. Multiply two 2x2 matrices using matrix multiplication (`@` or `dot`).
8. Use boolean indexing to extract all even numbers from a NumPy array.
9. Create a 3D array of shape (2, 3, 4) filled with sequential numbers.
10. Use `np.where()` to replace all negative values in an array with 0.
