# üêç NumPy and Pandas in Python Day 6 ‚Äì Practice Questions

## üü¢ Beginner Level Questions

1. Create a DataFrame and group it by a single column using `groupby()`.
2. Calculate the sum of values for each group in a DataFrame.
3. Group a dataset by two columns and compute the mean.
4. Sort a DataFrame by a specific column in descending order.
5. Filter a DataFrame to return rows with values greater than a threshold.
6. Merge two DataFrames using a common key (inner join).
7. Concatenate two DataFrames row-wise using `pd.concat()`.
8. Perform a left join on two DataFrames.
9. Group a DataFrame by one column and count the rows in each group.
10. Combine multiple DataFrames using `pd.concat()` and reset index.

## üü° Intermediate Level Questions

1. Group a DataFrame by a column and apply multiple aggregation functions.
2. Group and filter to return groups where the sum is above a threshold.
3. Perform an outer join on two DataFrames with mismatched keys.
4. Merge DataFrames on different column names using `left_on` and `right_on`.
5. Sort a DataFrame by multiple columns (ascending and descending mix).
6. Filter a DataFrame using `.query()` method with compound conditions.
7. Group by and normalize values within each group.
8. Merge DataFrames with suffixes to distinguish similar column names.
9. Concatenate multiple DataFrames column-wise and rename columns.
10. Use `.agg()` with custom lambda functions on grouped data.

## üî¥ Advanced Level Questions

1. Group by a column and compute weighted averages.
2. Perform a full outer merge and then fill missing values.
3. Group by two columns and pivot the result for reporting.
4. Chain groupby, filter, and transform operations.
5. Use `.transform()` to broadcast group-level computations to original DataFrame.
6. Merge multiple DataFrames using reduce and functools.
7. Create a function to auto-merge a list of DataFrames on a common key.
8. Create a multi-level index with groupby and perform aggregation.
9. Use `.combine_first()` to merge and fill missing values.
10. Benchmark performance of merging large DataFrames with various join types.
